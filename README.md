# Making a single-file executable with node and esbuild

This repository elaborates on on node's [skimpy instructions](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html) by showing how you might bundle an app with multiple files and a dependency, and build it into an executable binary.

I wrote a guide [here](https://notes.billmill.org/programming/javascript/Making_a_single-file_executable_with_node_and_esbuild.html) that walks you step by step through how you might end up with something similar to the code in this repository.

This repository's main addition to that article is a simple `Makefile` that will build the executable binary into `dist/sum` on either mac or linux.

## Building the code in this repository

On a mac or linux computer:

- clone this repository and cd into it
- execute `make`

You should end up with a `sum` binary in the `dist` folder, which will be an executable file that sums up all the numbers you pass to it.

For example:

```console
$ make
npm i

$ ls -alh dist/sum

```

## Stripping the binary

Using [`strip`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strip.1.html) to remove debug symbols from the node binary results in a binary that is 66 megabytes instead of 82 on my local computer, with node v20.2.0.

In the [container provided in this repo](https://github.com/llimllib/node-esbuild-executable/blob/d7a6db6083a16732e9995ed824090f131496d2e3/Dockerfile), it saves about 16mb on the binary.

**I'm not sure this is safe to do in general**, but it works in this case and saves some space so I've [put it in the Makefile](https://github.com/llimllib/node-esbuild-executable/blob/004bfbe97e0d4e516e2d8665003772e95678b150/Makefile#L13). If you see adverse effects with it, or you want to debug your binary with `gdb` or `lldb`, you may want to remove it.

## Benchmarks

`make bench` will run the compilation processes for `node`, `bun`, and `deno` and report build time, the reuslt of a benchmark, and file size.

On my system (Macbook Pro with M1 Max and 32gb ram), which I should emphasize **is not set up to do proper benchmarking** so take this whith a large pile of salt, I get:

| interpreter | version | build (ms) | size (mb) | execution time     |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| node        | 20.11.1 | 3290       | 67        | 86.6 ms Â± 168.0 ms |
| bun         | 1.0.29  | 690        | 77        | 77.1 ms Â± 180.0 ms |
| deno        | 1.41.0  | 490        | 58        | 76.0 ms Â± 147.4 ms |

## Comparison with bun

You can build a binary with [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler#target), if you have it installed, by running `make dist/sum_bun`

I tested with bun version `1.0.25` against a node binary build with node version `20.11.1`

**Pros**

- faster to build
- much simpler build command
- executable is 46mb, vs 82mb for node
- the executable runs with low overhead

**Cons**

- bun is a rapidly evolving distribution and still has bugs in its node compatibility
  - for example, a recent program I tried to build with `bun` hit [this showstopper bug](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/6832). Every program I've tried to build with bun so far has hit a bug somewhere or other with bun's node compatibility.
  - my recommendation would be to build with bun only if you intend to exclusively build with bun as a target; otherwise you're likely to suffer compatibility bugs like this one at unexpected and inconvenient times

## Comparison with deno

You can build a deno version of this binary with `make dist/sum_deno`, which runs `deno compile -o dist/sum_deno ./deno/index.js`

**Update**: Deno version 1.40.2, which I had previously used, generated a very large binary that was extremely slow; it appears [they have improved executable generation greatly](https://deno.com/blog/v1.41) in version 1.41.0, which generates a smaller and faster binary. I used 1.41.0 for the below

**Pros**

- much simpler compilation command
- the resulting binary is between `bun` and node SEA in size (58mb)
- the executable runs with low overhead

## Why use make?

Because it's still great at what it was meant to do: build binaries out of source files when they change.

## TODO

- I would love to support windows! But I haven't used a windows computer in 20 years. Pull requests would be gladly accepted
- I'd also love ideas about how to make the binary any smaller than its current weight of 82 megabytes
  - see: [stripping the binary](#stripping-the-binary)
- add a demo of [bytecode compiling](https://github.com/nodejs/single-executable/issues/66#issuecomment-1517250431) with [bytenode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytenode)
